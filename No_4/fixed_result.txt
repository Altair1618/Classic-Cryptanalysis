Hello! Ai Habara The Ukraine-born winner of the Miss Japan pageant has relinquished her crown after a report emerged of an affair she had with a married doctor. Karolina Shiino's nomination in January first sparked debate after some right-wingers questioned the title being awarded to a naturalized Japanese citizen. A scandal then erupted over her private life when weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported on her extramarital relationship, taboo for beauty pageant contestants, who are held to squeaky-clean moral standards. Japanese entertainment personalities who have affairs, dabble in drugs, or suffer other scandals also often find themselves shunned by their fans and employers. The Miss Japan Association said Monday that it had accepted a request from Shiino to return the crown for personal reasons, adding there would be no Miss Japan. Foconan
